## Algorithm and Data Structures (Leetcode exercises)
-   Linked Lists: 
    The linked list in Javascript is a data structure that stores a collection of ordered data that can only be accessed sequentially. The data element (technically a node) consists of some information and a pointer. In contrast to an array, data elements in a linked list are not stored at contiguous memory locations and thus cannot be accessed randomly.

    ** Types of Linked lists **
    1. Singly Linked List
    This is the most basic linked list that we were discussing till now, it can be traversed only in one direction that is from start to end. Only one-directional access is allowed.

    2. Doubly Linked List
    The node of this linked list contains two pointers instead of one, making it possible to access the next as well as the previous node from the current node.

    We can access the linked list from both directions.
    We can insert a node before the current node easily.

    3. Circular Linked List
    The last node of the linked list instead of pointing to null points to the first node.

    We can traverse this linked list in a sequential as well as circular manner.
    It is generally used in the queue-related concepts.
